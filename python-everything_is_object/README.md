# python-everything_is_object

## Project Description

This project is part of the Introduction to Programming and Databases module.  
It focuses on Python’s object model, specifically how Python handles object identity, mutability, and assignment behavior.

Through a series of quiz tasks and a mandatory blog post, this project helps reinforce important Python concepts such as:
- Mutable vs Immutable Objects
- Aliasing and Cloning
- Object References and Identifiers
- Python's memory model and variable behavior

## Project Structure

alu-higher_level_programming/
└── python-everything_is_object/
├── 0-answer.txt
├── 1-answer.txt
├── 2-answer.txt
├── ... (up to 28-answer.txt)
├── 19-copy_list.py
├── README.md



- `.txt` files contain single-line answers to quiz tasks.
- `19-copy_list.py` contains a function to copy a list in Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- pycodestyle 2.7.*
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

## How to Run Scripts

Make sure the Python files are executable:

```bash
chmod +x 19-copy_list.py
Run using:

bash


./19-copy_list.py
How to Verify Answer Files
Check each .txt file using:

bash

cat 0-answer.txt
Each file must contain:

One single line

No extra spaces

Ends with a newline

Learning Objectives Covered
What is an object in Python

Difference between class and instance

Mutable vs Immutable objects

References, assignments, and aliases

How to check if two variables share the same object

Using id() and type() functions

Built-in mutable and immutable types in Python

Blog Post Requirement
As part of this project, a technical blog post was published to summarize these concepts.
The blog includes:
