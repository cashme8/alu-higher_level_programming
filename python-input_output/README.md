##  python-input_output Project

Welcome to the Python Input/Output project! This set of tasks is designed to strengthen your understanding of reading, writing, and serializing data using Python. Below is a human-friendly overview of what each script does and how they fit together.

---

## Project Structure

- `0-read_file.py`: Reads and prints the content of a text file.
- `1-write_file.py`: Writes a string to a file, overwriting existing content.
- `2-append_write.py`: Appends a string to the end of a file.
- `3-to_json_string.py`: Converts Python objects into JSON strings.
- `4-from_json_string.py`: Converts JSON strings back into Python objects.
- `5-save_to_json_file.py`: Saves Python objects as JSON into a file.
- `6-load_from_json_file.py`: Loads Python objects from a JSON file.
- `7-add_item.py`: Adds command-line arguments to a Python list and saves them in a JSON file.
- `8-class_to_json.py`: Converts a class instance into a dictionary for JSON serialization.
- `9-student.py`: Defines a `Student` class with a method to convert its attributes into a dictionary.
- `10-student.py`: Adds attribute filtering to the `Student` class serialization.
- `11-student.py`: Adds the ability to reload `Student` attributes from a dictionary.
- `12-pascal_triangle.py`: Generates Pascal's Triangle up to `n` rows.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/alu-higher_level_programming.git
   cd alu-higher_level_programming/python-input_output
   ```

2. Run each script with Python3:
   ```bash
   python3 0-main.py
   ```

   Replace `0-main.py` with the main file you want to test.

3. Install Python if needed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3
   ```

##  Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Basic understanding of file handling, JSON serialization, and classes in Python.
